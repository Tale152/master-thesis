 I would like to acknowledge and give my warmest thanks to my supervisior \textbf{Professor Alessandro Ricci} for guiding and supporting me through the stages of writing this project.\newline

 \noindent The completion of this work would not be possible without my girlfriend, \textbf{Elisa Tronetti}; thanks for your continuous support during this time, your love is what kept me going.\newline

 \noindent A special thanks also goes to:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Luca Rossi}, \textbf{Angelo Filaseta}, \textbf{Tommaso Bailetti} and, once again, Elisa Tronetti, for helping me to perform the prototype's real-world experiments
    \item \textbf{Elisa Mencucci}, for helping me to keep my English grammar in check while writing this thesis
    \item \textbf{Professor Gylfi Þór Guðmundsson}, for igniting this project idea in me through his teachings in his excellent course in Reykjavík University
 \end{itemize}

 \noindent Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and my friends for the support during this long, difficult, but rewarding journey.\newline
 
 \noindent I'm really grateful to all of you from the bottom of my heart, thanks for making me the person I am today.
