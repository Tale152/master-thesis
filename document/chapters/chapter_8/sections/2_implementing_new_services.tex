\section{Implementing new Grid Services}
Given the high focus on expandability that has driven this project, the possibilities for expanding the Grid's capabilities are endless. This section lists some ideas for future Grid Services.

\subsection{Simpler Services: Computation delegation}
The MapReduce Service is a fantastic tool, but it is not ideal in every use case; MapReduce's limitations are well known in circumstances where the data pool to analyze is very limited in size and, thus, a simple computation delegation service is more indicated in those situations. By removing the recruitment process and the coordination between multiple entities, an Invoking Point can delegate a computation to a more powerful Node that will remotely execute the requested computation.

\subsection{More than computations: Storage sharing}
Another wasted resource in users' Devices is storage space, frequently remaining unused; thus, another possibility for a Grid Service is to allow Contributors to share said storage space, implementing a distributed file retrieval system correlated with replication and fault tolerance mechanisms.

\subsection{Reaching the physical world: Collective computing}
Finally, one particular trait of mobile devices is the presence of multiple sensors. Given the participation of said devices to the Grid, some services can offer the possibility to access said sensors in order to obtain physical world data from the mobile devices of Contributors that allow such data retrieval.
