\section{Implementing new Grid Services}
Given the high focus on expandability that has driven this project, \textbf{the possibilities for expanding the Grid's capabilities are endless}. This section lists \textbf{some ideas} for future Grid Services.

\subsection{Simpler Services: Computation delegation}
The MapReduce Service is a fantastic tool, but it is not ideal in every use case; \textbf{MapReduce's limitations are well known in circumstances where the data pool to analyze is very limited in size} and, thus, a simple computation delegation service is more indicated in those situations. By removing the recruitment process and the coordination between multiple entities, \textbf{an Invoking Point can delegate a computation to a more powerful Node that will remotely execute the requested computation}.

\subsection{More than computations: Storage sharing}
Another wasted resource in users' Devices is storage space, frequently remaining unused; thus, another possibility for a Grid Service is to \textbf{allow Contributors to share said storage space}, implementing a \textbf{distributed file retrieval system correlated with replication and fault tolerance mechanisms}.

\subsection{Reaching the physical world: Collective computing}
Finally, \textbf{one particular trait of mobile devices is the presence of multiple sensors}. Given the participation of said devices to the Grid, \textbf{some services can offer the possibility to access said sensors in order to obtain physical world data} coming from the mobile devices of Contributors that allow such data retrieval.
