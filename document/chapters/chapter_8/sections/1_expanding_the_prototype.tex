\section{Expanding the prototype}
The prototype seen in the previous chapter is just a fraction of the architecture theorized in this thesis work; this means that, with an incremental approach, further development for the actual software entities has to be made, starting from:
\begin{itemize}
    \item iOS tested compatibility
    \item An easy-to-use GUI for the Interconnected Desktop Client, coupled with a guided installation process and automated start
    \item MapReduce algorithm implementation completion
    \item Making the Invoking Endpoint an actual dependency usable by other projects
\end{itemize}

Once these steps are completed, reaching a stability and maturity in the project development, the cloud side must be expanded with the final goal of obtaining the engineered cloud structure, starting from the creation of the dynamic system centered around the Grid Master Service.

After reaching a full working architecture, the next step in the evolution of the project comes from the implementation of new Grid Services.
