\chapter{Interconnected: a working prototype}
This chapter discusses the creation of a working prototype that realizes a subset of core functionalities of the system. First off, the goals and context for the prototype are discussed. Then, the simplified architecture for the prototype is presented, providing also details on the realization of the single entities that compose such architecture. The third section will then contain a brief explanation of the setup related to DevOps methodologies. After that, the Coordination section will talk about the messages exchanged between the entities in order to realize the desired functionalities. Concluding this chapter, the simplified Proto-MapReduce implementation realized will be discussed and, after that, data regarding real-world experiments will be presented.
