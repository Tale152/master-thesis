\section{Coordination}\label{coordination}
This section analyses the messages exchanged between the entities composing the prototype architecture. There are three phases in this coordination process:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Grid connection}
    \item \textbf{Recruitment}
    \item \textbf{P2P messaging}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Grid connection}
This phase connects a Node (whether used by the Mobile or the Desktop client) or an Invoking Endpoint Prototype to the Broker Service using a Socket connection through the Socket.io framework. The Broker Service registers the connections and uses them in the Recruitment phase.

\subsection{Recruitment}
The recruitment phase connects a requestor device (that becomes the Master in the P2Pconnection) to an actual device that will perform a Contribution (becoming the Slave). While a Slave is necessarily a Node, a Master can either be an Invoking Endpoint or a Node, allowing to obtain either a both Invoking Endpoint to Node connection or a Node to Node connection.

This phase is executed exchanging messages between the soon-to-be Peers using the previously established Socket connections, but ends with a direct P2P connection between the Master and the Slave through the WebRTC framework.

\end{figure}

\textit{Figure \ref{fig:recruitment_messages}} shows the actual messages exchanged in this phase: the soon-to-be Master sends a RECRUITMENT\_REQUEST to the Broker Service, containing details regarding which kind of resources are needed; the Broker Service, upon receiving this request, creates a pending Recruitment Request and broadcasts a RECRUITMENT\_REQUEST message to all the connected Nodes.

The Node checks locally if it is compatible with the received request and, if all the conditions are true, it sends a RECRUITMENT\_ACCEPT message to the Broker Service which, upon receiving it, checks if the request is still unsatisfied, eventually forwarding the message to the entity that first emitted the request.

From this point on, the P2P connection is initialized exchanging the WebRTC's required information (previously discussed in \textit{section \ref{interconnected_node}}): the Master sends a REQUEST\_CONNECTION message, containing its SPD offer and, in response, the Slave sends its SDP answer contained in a ANSWER\_CONNECTION message. Once the two Peers posses each other's SDP data structures, they start to exchange ICE candidates until they reach an agreement, finally opening the P2P connection, completing the Recruitment.

Although the broadcast is executed once, the messages contained in the "Broker accepts Node recruitment" scope need to be exchanged every time a new P2P connection is established among two Peers.

\subsection{P2P messaging}
Once the P2P connection is established, \textit{figure \ref{fig:p2p_messages}} shows the messages that the Master and the Slave exchange in their interaction.

\end{figure}

The Master sends a START\_JOB message to the Node, possibly including data (which need to be sent only once) that will later be useful when executing the specific Tasks for that Job. Once the Node has started said Job, the Master sends a EXECUTE\_TASK message, containing further data that, combined with the Job's payload, are used to perform a computation. Upon receiving the EXECUTE\_TASK message the Slave sends an ACK to the Master and enqueues the Task, sending a TASK\_COMPLETED message (containing the result) to the Master.

This asynchronous organization allows the Master to send multiple Tasks to enqueue without waiting that the Slave has already completed its Tasks, speeding up the process.
The Tasks submission and collection of results continues until all the Master's Tasks are completed and the P2P connection is terminated, removing the Job from the Slave.

Using this Job/Task generalization it is possible to express various kinds of Grid Services, starting from the MapReduce one.
