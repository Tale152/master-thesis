\subsection{Even greater focus on security}
\textbf{As the number of smartphone increases}, the number of computers used by people are gradually declining (\textit{figure \ref{fig:global_sales_of_pcs_and_smartphones}}); as a direct consequence of this phenomenon, \textbf{malicious attack efforts are now being redirected to exploiting mobile devices' vulnerabilities}.

    \label{fig:mobile_vulnerabilities}
\end{figure}
\textit{Figure \ref{fig:mobile_vulnerabilities}} shows how \textbf{Android has more vulnerabilities compared to iOS}. This can be explained for the following two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Android devices are more diffused}\\
    Attackers tend to attack these devices more since the pool of individual units is larger (as shown in \textit{image \ref{fig:os_market_share_2012_to_2021}}) and thus obtaining a profit is more likely.
    \item \textbf{iOS has more strict security measures} \cite{mobile_security}\\
    One of the byproducts of designing Android to be able to run a vast number of different hardware is the fact that compromises have to be made in order to grant compatibility. On the other hand, iOS runs on only a limited number of models, making it easier to design more effective security mechanisms. 
\end{itemize}
Through the \textbf{Linux Kernel}, Android resources are managed and protected. Furthermore, Android employs an \textbf{Application Sandbox} security mechanism, meaning that each application is run with a unique ID and the \textbf{processes are executed in spaces separated from each other and from the Kernel}, therefore preventing an application to interfere with the functioning of another. Despite this, Android employs an \textbf{authorization-based mechanism for accessing resources}; while \textbf{a process that has not the correct authorizations cannot access determinate resources}, the greatest weakness of this mechanism is the fact that \textbf{authorizations are granted by the user} which, usually, is not really aware of the implications of such choices. Application, consequently, can launch \textbf{various types of attacks depending on the type of authorizations} that they obtained. Another weakness of Android systems is the fact that \textbf{Application provenance is not guaranteed}; the Play Store's digital certificate can be easily obtained from malicious parties since Google only requires a fee paid by a credit card to get it (and payments might be done with a stolen credit card). Applications can also be installed from third parties, making it easier to introduce malicious software that is completely unchecked.

On the other hand, \textbf{iOS} utilizes a similar Sandbox system, but \textbf{authorizations are completely managed by the OS}, removing the possibility of human errors. From the Application provenance perspective, iOS' applications are only distributed by the App Store; developers have to register, pass a \textbf{vetting process} that evaluates the Application which, in case no harm is detected, is \textbf{digitally signed} and only then published on the store. This process makes more difficult the introduction of harmful applications.

    \caption{iOS and Android vulnerabilities severity score from 2015 to 2019 \cite{mobile_security}}
    \label{fig:mobile_vulnerabilities_severity}
\end{figure}
Even though iOS has the advantage when it comes to sheer number of security breaches, \textbf{with time the severity of Android's breached has decreased, becoming less severe than the iOS' ones} (\textit{figure \ref{fig:mobile_vulnerabilities_severity}}).

This data highlights how it is particularly important to focus on the security of the Grid's Fabric Layer (\textit{section \ref{fig:fabric_layer}}) while dealing with mobile devices because, in the current panorama, they are the greatest source of security vulnerabilities, especially considering that the information inside them has great value for attackers.
