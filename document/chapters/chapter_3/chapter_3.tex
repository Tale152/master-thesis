\chapter{Integrating mobile devices into the Grid}
After having discussed how Grid computing works and the intrinsic challenges of such technology; now it is time to move towards the specific domain of this work: integrating mobile devices into Grid Computing. First it will be discussed the challenges specifically derived from the inclusion of such devices in the system. Then, the focus will shift to a discussion of an architecture proposed by a previous work. This will be useful since the solution that this work proposes takes some ideas from that architecture.
