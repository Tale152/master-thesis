\chapter{Integrating mobile devices into the Grid}\label{integrating_mobile_devices_into_the_grid}
After having discussed how Grid computing works and the intrinsic challenges of such technology, now it is time to move towards the specific domain of this work: integrating mobile devices into Grid Computing. First, the challenges specifically derived from the inclusion of such devices in the system will be discussed. Then, the focus will shift to a discussion of some architectures proposed by previous works. This will be useful since the solution that this work proposes takes some ideas from those architectures.
