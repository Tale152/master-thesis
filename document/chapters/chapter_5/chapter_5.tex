\chapter{Transparent scheduling model over heterogeneous devices}
After all the necessary context introduced by the previous chapters, here the solution proposed by this work will start to be discussed. In particular, the first section focuses on discussing the characteristics of the solution while the second and last chapter presents an analysis where the Domain, the Use Cases and the Requirements are addressed, preparing the ground for the next chapter where an Architecture implementing this solution will be shown.
