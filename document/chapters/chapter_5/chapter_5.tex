\chapter{Design}
Here the design of a software architecture concretizing the model described in the previous chapter will be discussed.
First, the architecture itself will be discussed; following that, the use cases described in \textit{section \ref{use_cases}} will be explained in terms of how the entities composing the architecture communicate among each other in order to satisfy such use cases. Concluding this chapter, a formalization of the desired MapReduce Service's behavior is presented.
