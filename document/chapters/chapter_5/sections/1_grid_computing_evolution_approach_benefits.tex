\section{Grid computing evolution: this project's solution}
Coming from the overview on how Grid Computing works (\textit{chapter \ref{how_grid_computing_works}}), followed by the challenges and previous ideas on how to integrate mobile devices into the Grid (\textit{chapter \ref{integrating_mobile_devices_into_the_grid}}), finally concluded by an overview on the MapReduce paradigm (\textit{chapter \ref{the_mapreduce_paradigm}}), it is now time to expand this project's idea introduced in \textit{chapter \ref{introduction}}.

The solution proposed by this work takes the name of "Transparent dispatcher model over heterogeneous devices"; the model aims to maintain the core characteristics of a Grid computing system while, at the same time, redesign some aspects in order to enhance and evolve its capabilities to better accommodate new necessities arising from the new technological panorama.

In particular, this Grid computing system (following the cloud computing concept) aims to offer services, ranging from simple to complex ones, to everyone that might need access to a large pool of computational resources. An example of computationally demanding distributed service is the execution of a MapReduce computation, which will be the service realized for this project's prototype.

This section, then, presents the project's aspects that differ from a traditional Grid computing approach and the reasons why it might represent a viable alternative to current Cloud computing services.
