\chapter{The MapReduce paradigm}
This short chapter discusses the MapReduce paradigm, concluding the overview of the problem before exploring the solution proposed by this work. Firstly, a definition and the history of such paradigm will be provided. Then, the programming model will be discussed, explaining the basic concepts needed to utilize MapReduce; following that, an overview of the master-slave architecture is provided. Continuing the chapter, in an attempt of clarifying as much as possible how the actual execution of a program that employs MapReduce works, fist an easy example of a MapReduce computation is displayed, then, an analysis of the execution flow is presented. To conclude this chapter, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the inner working of MapReduce are explained.
