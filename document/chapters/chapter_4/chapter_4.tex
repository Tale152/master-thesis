\chapter{The MapReduce paradigm}
This short chapter discusses the MapReduce paradigm, concluding the overview of the problem before exploring the solution proposed by this work. Firstly, a definition and the history of such paradigm will be provided. Then, the programming model will be discussed, explaining the basic concepts needed to utilize MapReduce. Trying to clarify as much as possible how the actual execution of a program that employs MapReduce works, fist an easy example of a MapReduce computation is displayed, then, an analysis of the execution flow is presented. To conclude this chapter, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the inner working of MapReduce are explained.
