\subsection{Data structures}
As anticipated during the exploration of the workflow, the Master acts as a coordinator and an intermediary between the Worker nodes; it mainly keeps two data structures in memory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tasks' state}\\
    For every Map task and every Reduce task (for a total number of M + R), the Master keeps track of the current state, that can be either idle, in progress or completed.
    \item \textbf{Intermediate results location}\\
    The master stores the locations and sizes of the R intermediate file regions produced by the map task in order to communicate said data to the Reduce Workers that are in the "in progress" state.
\end{itemize}
